                    My first couple of days with the camera went better than I expected them to go!
                    I thought I would get horrible shots and I would be completely lost in the camera settings; however,
                    I was pleasant surprised by some of the shots I got.

                    One thing that I was messing with was the F-stop of the camera. I had it locked on f/1.8 for my outing with 
                    the dragonflies, but when I uploaded those pictures on my computer, I wasn't satisfied with the result. The 
                    F-stop was too so when I had the head of the dragonfly in focus, the rear wings were falling out of focus.
                    My goal was to have the entire dragonfly in focus which made go back out and attempt more shots with a higher F-stop.
                    This ended up working great!

                    I also did mess around with some editing in Darktable and tried to make this photo of Stella look like a polaroid.
                    The photo was taken in a dark room so it had some natural grain to it so I felt like it would make a good canidate.
                    I don't think it turned out too bad but I think I could do better.

                    Up until this point, I was shooting in "Av" mode which allows me to choose the aperture and it takes care of the rest.
                    It was producing good results but I felt it was time to move into manual mode! I just wanted to make a post about my
                    thought process of choosing settings. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The first thing I choose is the aperture. It has a huge impact on the look of the photo so I like not worrying about other settings 
                    when choosing it. The others can compensate for any extra/loss of light hitting the sensor. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The next thing I choose is the shutterspeed. My goal is use the fastest shutterspeed as possible with a good exposure.
                    So I usually start at around 1/160 and back it down from there to find a good combo with the aperture I have. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lastly, I choose the ISO. I want to use the lowest ISO I can get away with after setting up my exposure with the aperture and shutterspeed.
                    It is important to not rely on the ISO to brighten up a photo because it will introduce a lot of digital noise to photos. 
                    Sometimes this is unavoidable though. For example, using a low shutterspeed while shooting a moving object in the darkness will not yield good results.
                    That's when you can use a slightly faster shutterspeed and let the ISO help out a bit. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    All of this sounds super formulaic, but that's just to get a starting point. After I set all these to what I think will be good, I take some test shots
                    and tweak from there. Sometimes I will think a 1/100 shutterspeed was enough for the light around me based on the exposure, but a dark test shot can prove that wrong. 
                    Prime example was me shooting the cats in my kitchen. It is way darker than I thought so I had to slow down the shutterspeed and up the ISO (they wouldnt stop moving!).

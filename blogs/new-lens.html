            <section>
                <p>
                    Big news! I got a new lens! I found a super good deal on a used
                    Canon 70-300 4-5.6 IS USM lens! I know what you're thinking, what 
                    the hell does all that mean? Well lets break it down!
                </p>

                <p>
                    The 70-300 shows the field of view of the lens, also known as the zoom. 
                    So this lens can have a field of view from 70mm all the way up to 300mm!
                </p>

                <p>
                    Next up is the 4-5.6 part. This shows the focal length minimum of the lens
                    at certain field of views. So this lens at 70mm, the minimum focal length is f/4.
                    Then at 300mm, the minimum focal length is f/5.6.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Lastly, we have IS and USM. Those are just some acronyms for the capabilities of the camera.
                    IS stands for image stabilization which helps shoot at a lower shutterspeed.
                    USM stands for Ultrasonic Motor which provides better autofocus. 
                    These silly letters are unique to Canon lenses, different manufacturers
                    will have different letters to explains these same capabilities. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Learning time over, look at some of the neat shots I got with this new lens!

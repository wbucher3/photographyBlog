                <p>
                    So far, all of my posts have been about my technical learning and have focused on how
                    to take an objectively good photo. Doing this is fun but it is not actually the main 
                    goal of photography for me. I've noticed I have been just sitting inside doing nothing a lot... 
                    like not going outside for days. So knowing that I've been wanting to learn about photography, 
                    I saw it as an opportunity to get out of the house more and immersive myself in nature.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This cow shoot really reminded me about that goal. Prior to it, I had sat inside for a couple days
                    and began to just feel pretty shitty. While laying in bed, I glanced over at my camera on my desk and
                    decided to go out and take some shots. Sick of shooting the wildlife in my yard, I jumped in my Miata
                    and drove down 42. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    I noticed this GIANT group of cows on a side road off 42 and I instantly pulled over to take their photo.
                    I sat there for about 30 minutes minutes moving up and down the road taking photos. The whole time I was
                    smiling ear-to-ear as these cows just munched on grass, totally unaware of the impact they were having on me.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I think it's super important to have these "ground truth" activities that can pull you out of rut you
                    may be stuck in. Just something that reminds you that there is something to smile about at the end of the day.
                    I know I've only had my camera for a little less than a month at this point, but I can already
                    tell this is something I will do for a long time to come. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Enjoy these cow photos, I have more coming soon with a twist! :D

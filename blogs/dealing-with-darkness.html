                    I've always known that light was important when taking a photo, but wow, it is so much more important than I originally thought. 
                    Luckily, the big three settings (aperture, shutterspeed, and ISO) all can help bring more light in when taking photos in less than ideal conditions.
                    However, I have found out the settings I need to use to get a good photo in the darkness make using the camera much more difficult, mostly the low shutterspeed.

                    I found myself in an awesome opportunity with a family of four raccoons on our back porch! I tuned in the exposure on my camera, however, to capture enough light, 
                    I needed a pretty low shutterspeed. This lead to a lot of the photos ending up blurry because I was shooting handheld. I know I will be taking more night photos so 
                    I think I am going to invest in tripod to make sure I can get some nice shots. The tripod would allow me to do some REALLY low shutterspeeds which would allow me to 
                    lower the ISO, reducing the noise in the photo.

                    I did end up getting a couple nice shots of the raccoons though despite the shakey hand cam! Enjoy!

                    One of the things I've started paying attention to while shooting is the histogram. 
                    The lil LCD screen can't always be trust when determining whether a photo turned out or not.
                    That's where the histogram comes in! It is a way where you can quickly check the 
                    shadows, midranges, and highlights of a photo on the fly! The main goal to have that graph be as flat as possible.
                    Having spikes near the edges can lead pixel values being squashed into pure whites or pure blacks which can't be fixed in editing.
                    Here's an image of what my camera tells me after I take a photo!
                    You can clearly see the histogram on the right side with most of the data in the center which is good!
                    It will give me the most amount of freedom to change brighness while editing.

                    Another thing I've learned to look at are those black spots in the photo preview. 
                    Those are areas that are over exposed and the pixels values are squashed into pure white.
                    This is bad because now I have no idea what the actual value of those pixel are!
                    Here is the image from that histogram and you can see the areas of over exposure that the black spots 
                    were indicating. This photo doesn't look bad despite having those spots because 
                    there is a lot of bokah from the high aperture.
